Project Plan

Objective: Make a Portfolio Website. 
Initially, I wanted to create a 3D website but decided that it will be another project. So for this Portfolio Website, it will adopt the style of a book where
each page is has contents about my skills, education, services, and contact-me page.

Stakeholders: Reyssan Sambitan (owner of the Portfolio) and is open for whoever is interested in viewing the website.

To create my vision, I will follow YouTube tutorials and learn from examples.
I am following Codehal's 3D Portfolio Website that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a website that imitates flipping a page like a book to see the next contetns.

After following Codehal's tutorial, there were trouble with the opening animations. The opening animation should start from the back of the book and each page flips until 
the first page shows up.

There were also trouble with clicking the contact me button. When this button is pressed this should flip the pages to the contact me page.
There is also a minor problem with the profile button. Since this button is at the last page, it is supposed to flip the pages back to the first page.

Currently I am trying to fix "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'classList')"
