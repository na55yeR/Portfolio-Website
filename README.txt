About:
This project is my porfolio website and it will simulate a book where the user has to click on the next/previous buttons to view the according pages.
The porfolio website will include my education background, previous work, my accomplishments, my services, my skills and it will also have a contact form page.

To run this website, you must have the required HTML file, CSS file and JavaScript file.
Once you have downloaded the required files, it is fairly simple to navigate through this website: click on the arrows to flip the page.
